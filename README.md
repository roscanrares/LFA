#  LFA - Formal Languages and Automata  

This repository contains implementations and practical examples of fundamental concepts in **Formal Languages and Automata (LFA)**.  

##  Features  
-  Implementations of **finite automata (DFA/NFA)** and their transformations.  
-  Definitions and simulations of **context-free grammars (CFG)**.  
-  Algorithms for **regular expressions**, model conversions, and word membership verification in formal languages.  

##  Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to provide useful resources for both **theoretical understanding** and **practical applications** of LFA, making it valuable for students and anyone interested in formal language theory.
